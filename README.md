Personal Website Workship: https://workshops.hackclub.com/personal_website/
Goal: Create a minimal website in 30-45 minutes, and then go on from there. 

Beginner iOS Dev Workshop: https://make.sc/gottacode , no need for XCode apparantly. Kinda dumb imo. 

Intermediate iOS Dev Workshop: https://www.makeschool.com/academy , make an account and go into iOS Apps (not the beta one).
